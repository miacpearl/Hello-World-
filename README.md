# Hello-World-
This project was for my Foundation of Business Analytics class, where we used excel to conduct descriptive analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, regression, and modeling to idenitiy statisically significant drivers of student grades.

## Project Title 

*Student Grade Driver*

## Description 

Analyzed a dataset of Portuguese student performance to identify key factors that drive final grades. Used Excel to run correlation and regression analysis to evaluate the impact of variables like study time, attendance, and past performance. Interpreted results to determine which factors were most predictive of academic success.

## Tools Used

- Excel
- Random sampling (RAND)
- Correlation analysis
- Multiple regression
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis

## Files Used

Used the Portugal Student Grades dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, working primarily with the student grades CSV file imported into Excel. Built a cleaned analysis workbook to organize the data and run correlation and regression analysis. This file was used to evaluate which factors were most predictive of final student performance.

## How to run program

Open the student grades CSV file in **Excel** and use the cleaned analysis workbook to run the analysis. Refresh the random sample using the **RAND** function if needed, then review the correlation and regression outputs in the designated tabs. The results will show which variables are most predictive of final grades.
